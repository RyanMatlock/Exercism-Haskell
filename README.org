These are my solutions to [[https://exercism.org/][Exercism]]'s [[https://exercism.org/tracks/haskell/exercises][Haskell exercises]]. For ease of future
reference, I've kept some dead code and GHCi REPL activity in the main branch
instead of buried in the commit history.

I've taken a stab at learning Haskell a few times in the past, but it feels
like I'm starting from scratch. Although I feel better prepared from
working with Lisp a little, it's likely that this won't be the cleanest Haskell
you've ever seen.
