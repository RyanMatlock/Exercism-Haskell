#+title: Collatz Conjecture

* First solution

#+begin_src haskell
  import Data.Maybe (fromMaybe)

  collatz :: Integer -> Maybe Integer
  collatz n
    | n < 1 = Nothing
    | n == 1 = Just 0
    | mod n 2 == 0 = Just $ (+) 1 $ fromMaybe 0 $ collatz $ n `div` 2
    | otherwise = Just $ (+) 1 $ fromMaybe 0 $ collatz $ (3 * n) + 1
#+end_src

But that's a little ugly. Let's see how we can improve it.

First of all, [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/14635050][we can use =succ= to increment a number by 1]]. +We can also clean
things up with parentheses.+ Actually, =$= makes things pretty clear, so the new
solution is =Just= (ðŸ™ƒ)

#+begin_src haskell
  collatz :: Integer -> Maybe Integer
  collatz n
    | n < 1 = Nothing
    | n == 1 = Just 0
    | mod n 2 == 0 = Just $ succ $ fromMaybe 0 $ collatz $ n `div` 2
    | otherwise = Just $ succ $ fromMaybe 0 $ collatz $ (3 * n) + 1
#+end_src
